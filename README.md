# Sarkari-sathi
Sarkari Sathi is a digital guidance platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government processes in Nepal. Navigating the requirements for official documents like Passports, Citizenship, and Driving Licenses can be overwhelming; this project simplifies those journeys through a modern, user-friendly interface and automated guidance.
